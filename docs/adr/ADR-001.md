# ADR-001: Choosing the Core Technology Platform

## 1. Context

The **Post Ou Cancer** platform requires a highly scalable, maintainable, and performant backend to support its complex, event-driven, and **Multi-Universe Architecture**. The chosen technology must satisfy several critical constraints:

* **High Performance (sub-150ms P95 latency)** for the "Stream" universe (micro-blogging).
* **Maximum Developer Velocity** for a single developer.
* **Unified Orchestration & Observability** to manage the modular monolith and its polyglot dependencies (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Python AI worker).
* **Architectural Integrity** to enforce the boundaries required by the Modular Monolith approach ([ADR-002](./ADR-002.md)).
* **Seamless Interoperability** with specialized services (e.g., the Python/FastAPI worker for AI).

## 2. Decision

We choose to adopt **.NET 10** as the primary backend technology platform, leveraging **.NET Aspire** for application orchestration and observability. This version, released in November 2025, is a **Long-Term Support (LTS)** release, ensuring three years of stability and support until November 2028.

## 3. Status

Accepted.

## 4. Consequences

### Positive ✅

* **Unmatched Performance**: .NET's highly optimized Kestrel web server, combined with Minimal APIs and modern language features, provides the raw performance necessary to meet the strict sub-150ms P95 latency target, especially for the real-time "Stream" universe.
* **Maximum Developer Velocity**: As the sole developer is highly proficient in C# and the .NET ecosystem, this choice eliminates any learning curve, directly translating to faster feature delivery and a reduced time-to-market.
* **Integrated Orchestration & Observability**: **.NET Aspire** ([ADR-003](./ADR-003.md)) provides a single, unified control plane for orchestrating the entire stack—including polyglot services like the Python AI worker. This dramatically simplifies local development, debugging, and deployment, which is a critical force multiplier for a solo developer.
* **Architectural Rigor**: The .NET platform and its tooling provide strong support for enforcing the strict boundaries of a **Modular Monolith** ([ADR-002](./ADR-002.md)) through project references and interfaces. This prevents architectural decay and ensures long-term maintainability.
* **Ecosystem Maturity & Stability**: As an LTS release, .NET 10 offers a stable, secure, and well-documented foundation. The mature ecosystem provides high-quality libraries (e.g., FastEndpoints, Mediator, MassTransit) that accelerate development of complex patterns like CQRS and event-driven architecture.

### Negative ❌

* **Polyglot Overhead**: The primary AI/ML worker will be a separate Python service. While **.NET Aspire** significantly simplifies its orchestration, this still requires maintaining a separate toolchain, knowledge domain, and testing strategy for that specific component.

## 5. Alternatives Considered

| Alternative                        | Rationale for Rejection                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Node.js (TypeScript + NestJS)**  | While performant for I/O-bound tasks, it lacks a first-party, deeply integrated orchestration and observability solution equivalent to .NET Aspire. Achieving the same level of unified management would require significant manual integration of disparate tools (e.g., Docker Compose, OpenTelemetry collectors, etc.), reducing developer velocity. |
| **Go (Gin/Echo)**                  | Excellent performance, but a significant learning curve/slower development for a C#-proficient developer. Lack of a unified orchestration solution like Aspire would complicate the deployment of the modular monolith and dependencies. |
| **Python (Django/FastAPI)**        | Suitable for the AI/ML component, but its performance and concurrency model are generally less optimized for I/O bound web server tasks compared to .NET, potentially missing the core latency target.                                   |
